	<p><b>Fact-check article date:</b> April 8, 2024 in a post:
Enter the date when your fact-check article was or will be published.<br> </p>
	<p><b>Fact-check </b>by ANDRE M. CHANG<br>
	</p>
	<p><b>Claim reviewed: "Strongest Earthquake In 25 Years" Hits Taiwan, 
	Tsunami Warning Issued</b><br>
	This is the statement that you checked. Feel free to paraphrase if that will make it clearer to readers. Google recommends keeping this to 75 characters to ensure that the claim fits in the space allotted.

This field should not be used to round up multiple claims (for example, don’t say “President Trump’s Iowa rally” or “the Democratic debate”). In articles where you are checking multiple statements, you should use the “Add another claim” button at the bottom of the form.<br>
	<b>Claim date:</b> April 1, 2024 (The day a person or entity made the claim.)<br>
	<b>Claim appearance:</b>
A URL for the web page or document where the claim appears, such as a link to the text of a speech, a YouTube video or a press release. If the claim appeared in multiple places, you can add additional URLs using the “Add another claim appearance” button.<br>
	<b>Claim author name:</b>
Name of the person or entity who made the claim. 

Consistency is key here. Always use the same version of names for people and organizations. Do not list the author’s job title here, since politicians change jobs and the ClaimReview will outlast their time in office (“First Name, Last Name” not “Senator Last Name”). By clicking “show more fields” below, you will find a separate field where you can add a person’s job title, if desired.<br>
